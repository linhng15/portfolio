              <p>I am hardworker.</p>
              <p>I am a learner. </p>
              <p> I don’t need all the answers to be successful, in fact it’s fun to put pieces of puzzles together. I placed myself in a coding boot camp program at <a href="https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern </a> because I want to explores new languages, opening new career windows, and to find myself a team. </p>
              <p>Admittedly, I’m still at a more experimental attitude. I learned from past occupations, I want stability and a safety net. Therefore, jobs like waitress, bartender, or even being nail technician doesn’t met my expectation on the long run. I learned being a bank teller or a secretary was not enough of a challenge. Anything related to biology was a fun read but it’s not a career choice. I tried working at nursing home, however I enjoyed providing companionship more than the work.  I was definitely too earnest, even so, I love the facts that I already figure out what I want and what I don’t want for my future. </p>
              <p>Although I’m not the best developer in the field, I have the confidence to do what is necessary to complete my task, my work experience is quite diversify, therefore I’m capable of handling any issues that may arise.  </p>
              <p>Aside from technology, I enjoys traveling and cooking. </p>
