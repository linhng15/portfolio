              <h2>A little more about myself...</h2>
              
              <p>As an enthusiastic individual who enjoys challenges, I would consider my strongest assets to be adaptability and perseverance.  I attended a lecture on front-end development after coming across a brochure on building applications.  Intrigued, I was driven to learn what was necessary through the successful completion of the coding boot camp at <a href="https://codingbootcamp.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>.  This tenure has provided invaluable insight in the effective operation of developing and creating software solutions through the building blocks of technology.</p>
              <p>I am prepared to use my Junior Software Developer skills acquired through the program and experiences to develop maintain and train in software programs improving functionality and building applications using everything from Java to managing life cycles. I have defined my abilities in quick problem solving and applying abstract and technical concepts to proven techniques. </p>
              <p>Admittedly, I am just beginning my journey into this domain.  From my experiences in the past, I have come to realize I crave job security above all.  I enjoyed biology in my younger days and earned a Bachelorâ€™s of Science upon graduation from college, however, I quickly discovered I enjoyed being part of a team involved in building an application from scratch even more.  The satisfaction gained from seeing the successful start-end cycle of an application was incredibly gratifying.</p>
              <p>I have a strong attention to detail, as I know that even the simplest error can lead to lost production and frustration. I am a computer geek at heart am quite skilled at developing programs and troubleshooting. I have been complimented for my skills at finding the problem and addressing it quickly.  Above all, I am flexible in learning and understanding different technologies to expand my knowledge base of the industry.  I am looking to constantly evolve and develop my skills further, and exert my full effort into my commitments towards projects which I believe are the key ingredients of an extremely rewarding career. </p>
